Introduction
==================================================

Zebra is an `OpenStack Swift <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift>`_ cloud storage container that is `ZeroVM <http://zerovm.org/>`_-enabled i.e. it is capable of running ZeroVM applications in addition to performing static storage operations.

How is this interesting and what can you do with it? In a nutshell, you can deploy and run applications that operate on cloud data directly, safely and with a high degree of parallelism.

An application will be written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and executes on a single cloud storage datum by virtue of the fact that ZeroVM instances are lightweight and short-lived.
